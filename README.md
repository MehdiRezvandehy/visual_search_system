# visual_search_system

This work builds a visual search system that retrieves images based on how similar they look to a given query image. It works by converting images into numeric representations that capture their visual features. These representations are then compared to find the most visually similar images from a collection. The system demonstrates how visual similarity can be used for tasks like finding duplicates, recommending related content, or organizing large image datasets. This end-to-end example shows the core steps from image processing to search and result visualization.
